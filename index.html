            <h2>My Motivation For Becoming a Frontend Developer</h1><br>
            <p>
                My journey toward becoming a front-end developer started in an unexpected way during a genetic course I took back in school. 
                As part of our curriculum, we conducted a gene test on a plant. The test itself was simple in theory, but what caught my attention was how  <span class="gu">a software</span> played a crucial role in running this test. 
                The plant samples were analyzed, and the software processed the data, showing results in graphs, charts, and tables.  
                It wasnâ€™t just the scientific process that intrigued me; it was how this software was able to turn raw data into meaningful, actionable information.
            </p> 
            <p>I started wondering, How does it work? How was it built?
                This curiosity led me to dive deeper into the world of software development, particularly front-end development. 
                I was fascinated by the idea of creating user-friendly interfaces that allow users to interact with complex systems. 
                The concept of bridging the gap between raw data and the way users engage with it on a screen really resonated with me.  
                From there, I was hooked. I realized that front-end development wasnâ€™t just about writing codeâ€”it was about creating experiences that allow people to understand and interact with complex systems,
                whether those systems are gene tests or digital services. The ability to work with data and display it in a meaningful way, to design clean and intuitive user interfaces, became my motivation to pursue a career in web development.
